This my first project after finishing the css and flexbox section of my course.
I believe using flexbox as much as I did led to more code then needed and issues I 
had to correct specifically on the mobile preview because of my reliance on flex box 
so it became a lot of problem solving issues I thought previous where solutions.
So I saw this as an oppertunity to get through it and simply gain more awareness starting the next project that is similar to this one. 

I apreaciate any tipps and feedback.
Thanks.
